chapter name : Experiment

This is one of the most important lessons of the scienti1c method: if you cannot fail,
you cannot learn.

The Lean Startup methodology reconceives a startup’s efforts as
experiments that test its strategy to see which parts are brilliant
and which are crazy

A true experiment follows the scienti1c method.

A true experiment follows the scienti1c method. It
begins with a clear hypothesis that makes predictions about what is
supposed to happen. It then tests those predictions empirically.

Just as scienti1c experimentation is informed by theory, startup
experimentation is guided by the startup’s vision. The goal of
every experimentation is guided by the startup’s vision. The goal of every
startup experiment is to discover how to build a sustainable
business around that vision.

AN EXPERIMENT IS A PRODUCT

If this or any other
experiment is successful, it allows the manager to get started with
his or her campaign: enlisting early adopters, adding employees to
each further experiment or iteration, and eventually starting to
build a product. By the time that product is ready to be distributed widely,
it will already have established customers. It will have
solved real problems and o9er detailed speci1cations for what
needs to be built. Unlike a traditional strategic planning or market
research process, this speci1cation will be rooted in feedback on what is
working today rather than in anticipation of what might work tomorrow.
