title of the chapter : Learn

Yet if the fundamental goal of entrepreneurship is to engage in
organization building under conditions of extreme uncertainty,
its most vital function is learning.

We must learn the truth about which
elements of our strategy are working to realize our vision
and which are just crazy. We must learn what customers really want,
not what they say they want or what we think they should want.
We must discover whether we are on a path that will lead to growing a
sustainable business.

Validated learning is not after-the-fact rationalization or
a good story designed to hide failures. It is a
rigorous method for demonstrating progress when one is embedded
in the soil of extreme uncertainty in which startups grow.

Metcalfe’s law: the value of a network as a whole is proportional to
the square of the number of participants.

The question is not “Can this
product be built?” In the modern economy, almost any product that
can be imagined can be built. The more pertinent questions are
“Should this product be built?” and “Can we build a sustainable
business around this set of products and services?” To answer those
questions, we need a method for systematically breaking down a
business plan into its component parts and testing each part
empirically.
